## About 
This project implements basic lending borrowing protocol similar to Compound where users can deposit assets into lending pool to earn interest , provide collateral to borrow assets from the pool. It implements Collateralization Ratio i.e. ration of value of collateral to value of loan . Interest rates are determined algorithmically based on supply and demand. If collateral value falls below a threshold, the loan is liquidated to protect the lenders
